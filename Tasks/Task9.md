## Task 9:

Project X is on an important mission! It needs to travel to the end of a frame and return to its starting point. However, there's a problem - Project X doesn't have enough speed to complete the journey and gets stranded somewhere along the return route.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it:
1. Calculate the current speed of Project X.
2. Calculate the minimum speed Project X needs to successfully complete the round trip in the same time.
3. Determine how much distance remains between Project X's stranded position and its starting point.

Can you help Project X complete its journey and find its way back home?

**Scale:**
- 1 frame = 2 minutes
- 1 pixel = 200 meters
